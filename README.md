# Covid-19
This is a example project requested by my teacher Dirceu Filho, I'm a student from UNIP University and his exercise consist in a 2D array basically, that when a cycle are runned, peoples, represented by numbers in the array, move into it and by default, always 1 person is infected with the virus Covid-19. And with the implemented logic, we can see the evolution of the contamination during the peoples movement into the matrix, I added a button to se the current status too, like, how many peoples are healtlhy, infected, recovered, and dead by the virus, an important observation, one cycle is equivalent of one week in this app.
